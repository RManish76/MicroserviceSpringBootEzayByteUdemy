*1* Dependency: Web, H2, JPA, Actuator, Lombok, validation

*2* Renamed the application.properties to application.yml
    yml work on identation like python.
    every . is replace with : and the text after : has to be in next line. And to pass the value
    instead of = in yml we just put : and a single space like below example
        In Properties
            spring.application.name=accounts
        In yml
            spring:
                application:
                    name: accounts

    Benifit if we have value like below in properties then you can note we are typing less words in yml.
        spring.datasource:url=jbdc:h2:mem:testdb
        spring.datasource:username=org.he.Driver
        
        In yml
            spring:
                datasource:
                    url: jbdc:h2:mem:testdb
                    username: org.he.Driver

    Also note that in yml each key is unique like spring should be used only one and all
    other method related to spring if we are calling it has to be below this spring only.
    We cannot initate another spring key in yml file.

    localhost:8080/h2-console   --> h2 console login page from browser if enable in yml/properties file.
    A form will come in h2 console which will auto populate some values from yml file make sure it matches
    the yml file.

*3* Creation of Schema for database
    Create a file with name schema.sql in resoruces folder where our application.properties or
    application.yml is located.
    In this schema.sql file we'll write query to create table.
        -- mistake, table & column need not to be quoted and if you want to do that then use either
        -- double quotes(") or brackets(`) this bracket symbol is below esc button in keyboard.
        -- Again best to not quote it. and single quote treated as string.
