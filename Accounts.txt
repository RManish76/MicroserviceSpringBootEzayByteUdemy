*1* Dependency: Web, H2, JPA, Actuator, Lombok, validation

*2* Renamed the application.properties to application.yml
    yml work on identation like python.
    every . is replace with : and the text after : has to be in next line. And to pass the value
    instead of = in yml we just put : and a single space like below example
        In Properties
            spring.application.name=accounts
        In yml
            spring:
                application:
                    name: accounts

    Benifit if we have value like below in properties then you can note we are typing less words in yml.
        spring.datasource:url=jbdc:h2:mem:testdb
        spring.datasource:username=org.he.Driver
        
        In yml
            spring:
                datasource:
                    url: jbdc:h2:mem:testdb
                    username: org.he.Driver
