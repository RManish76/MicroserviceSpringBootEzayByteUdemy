*1* Perviosuly we have seen ways to create image using 3 ways.
    1. using Dockerfile - > need learn too many things - not recomanded
    2. Build pack (heruko(packeto)) -> this downloads a docker image and that docker image helps to create
        docker images of jar file.
        we just need to add image name in pom under congifuration and run the command inside the project
        like accounts, loans, card and the command is "mvn spring-boot:build-image".
        Used in industries and available for most of the programming languages.
    3. jib google. - Developed by google. works only for java and this is we are going to use as it is fast
        and consume less space as it does not download too much things.
        
        We just need to add jib pulgin and edit the docker image name in pulgin then
        we just need to run the command "mvn compile jib:dockerBuild" 
        this does not download any support image and also it can work without docker desktop.


*2* Now the problem comes that we need to manually run the containers one by one giving them port etc
        To handle that we can create a file docker-compose.yml and add all details like images, ports etc
        and run that file, it'll create the containers and run it for us with single command.

        we just need to go to directory where our docker-compose.yml file is run command 
            "docker compose up -d"   -d for detach mode so that it does not ocupy the terminal
            "docker compose up -d"  --> creates containers from image and run them if container is not present. if persent it runs them
            "docker compose start" --> run the container if existing and if not existing will fail
        and to stop the containers 
            "docker compose stop" -  to stop the containers
            "docker compose down" - to stop and delete the containers (recomnded) and will be using
