*1* We want to access variables/properties value stored in application.yml.
    Till Now we have seen 3 methods.
    1. using @Value annotation
        In this method we use @Value("${build.version}"). Using this we are pulling build.version value
        from application.yml then assiging it to the variables we defined below it like below.
                    @Value("${build.version}") 
                    private String buildVersion;
        Problem: In this method we are hardcoding the properties variables and also if multiple value need to
            fetch then we have to do it manually.
            And if we have multiple controller then in each controller we need to do that.

        Another issue faced that we were using AllArgsConstructor and after running the application it caused
        failur beacuase it was looking for bean of buildVersion variables which we created.
        So commented the @AllArgsConstructor and build constructor dedicatly for IAccountServices.



    2. using Environment class
        In this method we first fetched Environment class.
        Now in this Environment class we have certian keywords using which we can fetch properties value.
        Like JAVA_HOME to pull the version of java being used in project.
                MAVEN_HOME to pull maven version being used in project.

        Pro: we don't need to hardcode the variables names of application.yml anymore.
        Con: Still we need remember or get what is the keywords for our requirement and also again
            for multiple controller we need use the same again and again

    3. using Configuration properties
        In this method whatever properties we want to fetch from application.yml we need to give it a prefix
        Same we did and the prefix is account.
        And inside that account we defined centain variables 

        Now to pull these values we created a DTO and this is of RECORD type not class not interface.
        In this Dto we just need to add annotation @ConfigurationProperties and pass the prefix which we created
                @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "accounts")
        and we just need to pass the variables of application.yml and it should be same as defined in application.yml

            Now we can use this Dto where we want to pull the properties value
        Note: we need to add annotation at root/AccountsApplication.java and pass the dto class here
                    @EnableConfigurationProperties(value = {AccountsContactInfoDto.class})

        Pro: No need of hardcoding anymore also since we have DTO we can easyly use it anywhere no
                matter how manually controller we have

        Cons: we are still keeping things hardcode in application.yml and if we are changing the Environment
            like dev, uat, prod then we may need to change the values in application.yml which needs code change

            We have two option for it one is profile creation and spirng will pick the profile what we pass
                like application_uat.yml, application_dev.yml, application_prod.yml
                Now we can use spring.profile.active = prod        this will activate on prod one.
                    and if we need to activate multiple file then we can pass comma seprated value.
            Second option is passing the value from outside lets see
