*1* Spring cloud project provides a dependency known as spring config server and spring config client.
        spring config server - > stores the details and properties so that other application can fetch
                                    details from here.
        Spring config client - > application which will fetch config details from config server.

        added dependency in configserver project
                -> config server, actuator

*2* Start
    Added @EnableConfigServer  --> saying to spring this project will be storing confgiuration/properties
            and other applications will fetch those details from it.

    There multiple way to store confgiuration details like classpath, file sysem, database, githubrepo etc
    we are going to discuss 3 of them
        1. Class Path storage
        2. Store it in file system in local or server and then we can read from that folder
        3. using github

*3* Added name of server which we want
        in application.yml we need to add spring.application.name="configserver"
        the name can be anything and this is the name we are going to use to for this sever and
        connect to this server
