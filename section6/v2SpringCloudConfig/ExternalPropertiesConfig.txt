*1* Spring cloud project provides a dependency known as spring config server and spring config client.
        spring config server - > stores the details and properties so that other application can fetch
                                    details from here.
        Spring config client - > application which will fetch config details from config server.

        added dependency in configserver project
                -> config server, actuator

*2* Start
    Added @EnableConfigServer  --> saying to spring this project will be storing confgiuration/properties
            and other applications will fetch those details from it.

    There multiple way to store confgiuration details like classpath, file sysem, database, githubrepo etc
    we are going to discuss 3 of them
        1. Class Path storage
        2. Store it in file system in local or server and then we can read from that folder
        3. using github

*3* Added name of server which we want
        in application.yml we need to add spring.application.name="configserver"
        the name can be anything and this is the name we are going to use to for this sever and
        connect to this server.

        Added confgiuration related to accounts, cards, loans in config folder under resources in configserver project

        now added spring.profiles.active=native in application.yml of configserver project
            this tell to spring cloud config servet that to cativate a native profile of spring cloud config
            server, so whenever we are trying to use a classpath to store all our configuration, we need to
            make sure we are activating the native profile.

            Once we define the profile activation details.

            now we need to add spring.cloud.config.server.native.search-locations="classpath/config"
            this mentions the serach location of profiles, using this property only we tell spring cloud
            config server where our properties are stored. And right now our properties are stored inside
            the classpath -> where properties are         config -> folder location of classpath

        now intital setup is done. lets run the configserver applicatiion
        after running we can serach in browser
            GET        localhost:8071/accounts/prod  -> to fetch accounts_prod.yml and accounts.yml properties
            GET        localhost:8071/cards/prod      -> to fetch cards_prod.yml and cards.yml properties
            GET        localhost:8071/accounts/default -> to get only default profile
        
        we got issue as we are getting only default accounts.yml with  link localhost:8071/accounts/prod 
            the issue is file nameing convetion.
            the name should be accounts-prod.yml not accounts_prod.yml similarly for others.

        After correcting the issue we are getting both default and prod profile.
        which is expected and when we activate the other application with prod profile they will pick
        the prod profile and ignore the default one.


*4* spring cloud config clinet
    Now we'll do configuration in accounts, card, loans as config client
        1st in accounts default profile applicatiion.yml we removed all profile details
        only kept applicatiion name as our applicatiion is going to find same name on config server
        then we also mentioned a default profile as prod so that our applicatiion start with prod profile
        by defaule if it able to find prod profile in config server.

    Added config client dependency to pom of accounts microservice.
    and since we are adding configClient we need not add spring cloude version as well and
    dependencyManagement also
